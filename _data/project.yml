      <p>Autonomous driving involves utilizing various sensors to perceive the surrounding environment and control the vehicle. Camera sensors, depending on their placement, type, and driving conditions, can exhibit disparities between images known as Domain Gap. Previous research has extensively applied Unsupervised Domain Adaptation techniques to overcome performance degradation due to photometry and texture gaps in images. However, most existing studies neglect the optical characteristics of cameras, especially geometric distortion in images. <br> Therefore, in this competition, we propose the development of an AI algorithm capable of achieving high-performance image segmentation (Semantic Segmentation) for distorted images (Target Domain). This will be accomplished by leveraging undistorted images (Source Domain) and their corresponding labels. </p>
      <p>We selected 'SePiCo: Semantic-Guided Pixel Contrast for Domain Adaptive Semantic Segmentation' as a method of Domain Adaptation</p>

        Existing water photovoltaic power generation uses the sun's semi-permanent energy and water, an idle resource. And this can only be applied on the water without waves. Therefore, we built a water-tracking solar power generation system.

        Laser cutting machines can easily process materials, but they are heavy and have the disadvantage that the size of the material is limited depending on the size of the laser cutting machine. Our team wants to compensate for the shortcomings of the laser cutting machine by using the Mechanum wheel. The driving equation and efficiency according to the direction of movement of the mechanical wheel are explored. It also develops a device that cuts the material by moving it according to the drawing.
