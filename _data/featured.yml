#     description: |
#         <p>It is a prevalent behavior of having a chat with strangers in online settings where people can easily gather. Yet, people often find it difficult to initiate and maintain conversation due to the lack of information about strangers.<br><br></p>
#         <p>Hence, we aimed to facilitate conversation between the strangers with the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms and present BlahBlahBot, an ML-infused chatbot that moderates conversation between strangers with personalized topics. Based on social media posts, BlahBlahBot supports the conversation by suggesting topics that are likely to be of mutual interest between users.<br><br></p>
#         <p>A user study with three groups (control, random topic chatbot, and BlahBlahBot; N=18) found the feasibility of BlahBlahBot in increasing both conversation quality and closeness to the partner, along with the factors that led to such increases from the user interview. Overall, our preliminary results imply that an ML-infused conversational agent can be effective for augmenting a dyadic conversation.<br><br></p>

#     description: |
#         <p>Prolonged time of computer use increased the prevalence of ocular problems including eyestrain, tired eyes, irritation, redness, blurred vision, and double vision, collectively referred to as computer vision syndrome. In this study, we aim to explore the interface elements of computer-based intervention for computer vision syndrome to set design guidelines based on pros/cons of each interface element.<br><br></p>
#         <p>In this project, I developed LiquidEye: an intervention application targeted to MacOS. In order to understand which design elements of intervention app do users prefer, we made the system to collect each user's time-series system preferences. We later jointly analyzed them with the self-reported satisfaction in order to identify the significance of each element statistically.<br><br></p>
