        <p>In the second half of 22, Team DAVENGERES was formed with members of Sogang University's data science association <INSIGHT>. We participated in the big contest data analysis league innovation field hosted by the Korea Intelligence Information Society Agency and Shinhan Card, and focused on directly processing data in the field and designing algorithms to extract insights. They collaborated efficiently by distributing roles such as data crawling and processing parts, visualization implementation parts, algorithm design and implementation parts, and form production, and won the top prize as the second overall.</p>
        <p>We started the project by diversifying management, computer engineering, and data for the theme of this innovation league, **Eco-friendly ESG Jeju Travel Route for the MZ Generation to Leave**. The given tasks were [1] After constructing a carbon footprint calculator for each travel area for transportation, F&B, accommodation, and tourism areas, [2] based on this, designing an eco-friendly travel route for Jeju for 3 nights and 4 days.</p>
        <p>Internal data was actively utilized in developing carbon footprint calculators, and raw data crawled from 'VISIT JEJU' & 'Naver Map' was supplemented in the complete configuration of logic. Travel was largely divided into transportation, restaurants, accommodation, and tourism, and data was refined, analyzed, and processed according to each logic to design and implement field-specific carbon calculators algorithms, implemented and distributed in Streamlit.</p>

The given tasks were [1] After constructing a carbon footprint calculator for each travel area for transportation, F&B, accommodation, and tourism areas, [2] based on this, designing an eco-friendly travel route for Jeju for 3 nights and 4 days.</p>
        <p>The implemented carbon footprint calculator was sufficient to use as basic data for the second task, the travel route recommendation system. We also approached business administration and thought about how to define a persona based on the designed route recommendation algorithm to design a route, and how to explain to the audience how personalized and recommended routes are printed. After clustering by measuring similarity from data using Word2Vec, we reduced it to t-SNE and applied it to facilitate visualization and calculated the destination score. We have implemented Hexagon that is customized to receive interactive input from users on natural, cultural sites, activities, hot place indices, travel density, and the degree of pursuit of good restaurants. Based on the rule-based machine learning algorithm, we compared the similarity between user matrix and processed tourist matrix obtained from the information we built with Streamlit and implemented a recommendation system based on the basis of recommending nearby tourist attractions, accommodations, and restaurants.</p>

#     description: |
#         <p>It is a prevalent behavior of having a chat with strangers in online settings where people can easily gather. Yet, people often find it difficult to initiate and maintain conversation due to the lack of information about strangers.<br><br></p>
#         <p>Hence, we aimed to facilitate conversation between the strangers with the use of machine learning (ML) algorithms and present BlahBlahBot, an ML-infused chatbot that moderates conversation between strangers with personalized topics. Based on social media posts, BlahBlahBot supports the conversation by suggesting topics that are likely to be of mutual interest between users.<br><br></p>
#         <p>A user study with three groups (control, random topic chatbot, and BlahBlahBot; N=18) found the feasibility of BlahBlahBot in increasing both conversation quality and closeness to the partner, along with the factors that led to such increases from the user interview. Overall, our preliminary results imply that an ML-infused conversational agent can be effective for augmenting a dyadic conversation.<br><br></p>

#     description: |
#         <p>Prolonged time of computer use increased the prevalence of ocular problems including eyestrain, tired eyes, irritation, redness, blurred vision, and double vision, collectively referred to as computer vision syndrome. In this study, we aim to explore the interface elements of computer-based intervention for computer vision syndrome to set design guidelines based on pros/cons of each interface element.<br><br></p>
#         <p>In this project, I developed LiquidEye: an intervention application targeted to MacOS. In order to understand which design elements of intervention app do users prefer, we made the system to collect each user's time-series system preferences. We later jointly analyzed them with the self-reported satisfaction in order to identify the significance of each element statistically.<br><br></p>
