<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The Königsberg bridge problem</p>

    <ul>
      <li>In the town of Königsberg, four land areas divided by the river Pregel are interconnected by seven bridges.</li>
      <li>The problem is to determine whether, starting at one land area, it is possible to walk across all the bridges exactly once in returning to the starting land area.</li>
      <li>In 1736, Leonhard Euler used the concept of a graph to address this problem.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An example walk in the town of Königsberg
    <ul>
      <li>start from area B $\rightarrow$ walk across bridge a to area A $\rightarrow$ take bridge e to area D $\rightarrow$ take bridge g to C $\rightarrow$ take bridge d to A $\rightarrow$ take bridge b to B $\rightarrow$ take bridge f to D</li>
      <li>This walk does not go across all bridges exactly once, nor does it return to the starting point.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Euler’s solution</li>
  <li>We can draw a graph which consists of vertices and edges.</li>
  <li>Each land area will become a vertex in the graph.</li>
  <li>Each bridge will become an edge that connects vertices corresponding to the land areas it interconnects.</li>
  <li>We define the degree of a vertex to be the number of edges incident to it.</li>
  <li>Then, there is a walk starting at any vertex, going through each edge exactly once and terminating at the start vertex iff the degree of each vertex is even.</li>
  <li>Since the degree of each vertex is not even in the Könisberg example, we cannot find the walk in this problem.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="612-definitions">6.1.2 Definitions</h3>

<ul>
  <li>A graph G consists of two sets, V and E.</li>
  <li>V is a finite, nonempty set of vertices.</li>
  <li>E is a set of pairs of vertices; these pairs are called edges.</li>
  <li>
    <p>(G) and E(G) represent the sets of vertices and edges of G.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We often use G=(V, E) to represent a graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In an undirected graph the pair of vertices representing any edge is unordered.
    <ul>
      <li>The pairs (u, v) and (v, u) represent the same edge.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>In a directed graph, each edge is represented by a directed pair &lt;u, v&gt;; u is the tail and v the head of the edge. A directed graph is also called a digraph.
    <ul>
      <li>The pairs &lt;u, v&gt; and &lt;v, u&gt; represent two different edges.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>G1 and G2 are undirected graphs / G3 is a directed graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Set representation of the sets</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>V(G1) = {0,1,2,3}; E(G1) = {(0,1),(0,2),(0,3),(1,2),(1,3),(2,3)}</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>V(G2) = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6}; E(G2) = {(0,1),(0,2),(1,3),(1,4),(2,5),(2,6)}</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>V(G3) = {0,1,2}; E(G3) = {&lt;0,1&gt;,&lt;1,0&gt;,&lt;1,2&gt;}</p>

    <p>Restrictions on graphs</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>A graph may not have an edge from a vertex, v, back to itself.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>(v, v) and &lt;v, v&gt; are not legal.</li>
          <li>Such edges are called self edges or self loops.</li>
          <li>Graphs permitting self loops are called a graph with self loops.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>A graph may not have multiple occurrences of the same edge.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <p>A graph allowing multiple edges between a pair of nodes is called a multigraph.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p>A graph that does not allow multiple edges between a pair of nodes is called a simple graph to distinguish it from a multigraph.</p>

            <p><img width="409" alt="image-20210923183657635" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135758451-845630d9-bfd1-477e-9b3c-f14a51865d28.png" /></p>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>The maximum number of edges in any n-vertex undirected graph:
    <ul>
      <li>Number of distinct unordered pairs (u, v).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If a graph with n vertices has exactly n(n-1)/2 edges, the graph is called a complete graph.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If (u, v) is an edge in E(G), we say the vertices u and v are adjacent, and the edge (u, v) is incident on vertices u and v.
    <ul>
      <li><img width="239" alt="image-20210923183834637" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135758452-1c0a3994-cc5b-46f2-ab67-05594d789170.png" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For a directed edge &lt;u, v&gt;, we say u is adjacent to v, and v is adjacent from u.
    <ul>
      <li>&lt;u, v&gt; is incident to u and v.</li>
      <li><img width="239" alt="image-20210923183903001" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135758455-0720688b-ace9-4bee-9256-0472b2c9b340.png" /></li>

  <li>A subgraph of G is a graph G’ such that and .

    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A path from vertex u to vertex v in graph G is a sequence of vertices u, i1, i2,…, ik, v such that (u, i1), (i1, i2), …, (ik, v) are edges in E(G)</li>
  <li>If G’ is directed, then the path consists of &lt;u, i1&gt;, &lt;i1, i2&gt;, …, &lt;ik, v&gt; in E(G’).</li>
  <li>The length of a path is the number of edges on it.</li>
  <li>An example path from 0 to 3: (0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (0, 3).
    <ul>
      <li>The length of the path is 4.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3) is not a path from 0 to 3 because (2, 3) is not in E(G).</p>
  </li>
  <li>A simple path is a path in which all vertices except possibly the first and the last are distinct.
    <ul>
      <li>(0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3) is a simple path from vertex 0 to vertex 3.</li>
      <li>(0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3), (3, 0) is a simple path from vertex 0 to vertex 0.</li>
      <li>(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 0), (0, 3) is not a simple path because vertex 0 is visited multiple times.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A cycle is a simple path in which the first and last vertices are the same.
    <ul>
      <li>(0, 2), (2, 1), (1, 3), (3, 0) is a cycle.</li>
      <li><img width="109" alt="image-20210923184127854" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135758457-4574c741-1fa7-499b-82bd-c1589cfb4b5b.png" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In an undirected graph G, two vertices u and v in V(G) are said to be connected $\iff$ there is a path in G from u to v.</p>
  </li>
  <li>An undirected graph is said to be connected $\iff$ for every pair of distinct vertices u and v in V(G) is connected.
    <ul>
      <li><img width="337" alt="image-20210923184150676" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135758459-2c14bdd8-4338-4565-9e70-0cd654ea547e.png" /></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A connected component H of an undirected graph G is a maximal connected subgraph.
    <ul>
      <li>By maximal, we mean that G contains no other subgraph that is both connected and properly contains H.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>A tree is a connected acyclic graph.
    <ul>
      <li>Acyclic means the graph has no cycles.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A directed graph G is said to be strongly connected $\iff$ for every pair of distinct vertices u and v in V(G), there is a directed path from u to v and also from v to u. G3 is not strongly connected, as there is no path from vertex 2 to 1.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A strongly connected component is a maximal subgraph that is strongly connected. G3 has two strongly connected components.</p>
  </li>
  <li>The degree of a vertex is the number of edges incident to that vertex.
    <ul>
      <li>The degree of vertex 0 in G1 is 3.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>If G is a directed graph, we define the in-degree of a vertex v to be the number of edges for which v is the head. The out-degree is defined to be the number of edges for which v is the tail.
    <ul>
      <li>Vertex 1 of G3 has in-degree 1, out-degree 2, and degree 3.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If di is the degree of vertex i in a graph G with n vertices and e edges, then $e = \frac{\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{d_i}}{2}$</p>
  </li>
  <li>assume the gramp is an undirected graph.</li>

<h3 id="613-graph-representations">6.1.3 Graph Representations</h3>

<ul>
  <li>The two most commly used representations
    <ul>
      <li>adjacency matrix</li>
      <li>adjacency list</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Choice of a particular representation will depend upon the application</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="6131-adjacency-matrix">6.1.3.1 Adjacency Matrix</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The adjacency matrix of $G=(V,E)$ is a two dimensional nxn array, a, with the property that $a[i][j] = 1$ $\iff$ the edge $(i, j)$ is in $E(G)$.
    <ul>
      <li>$a[i][j] $= 0 if $(i, j)$ is not in $E(G).$</li>
      <li>For a digraph, a[i][j] = 1 if &lt;i, j&gt; is in E(G).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>For a undirected graph, the adjacency matrix is symmetric.</li>
  <li>
    <p>For a digraph, the adjacency matrix may not be symmetric.</p>
  </li>
  <li>Space needed to represent a graph: n^2 bits.</li>
  <li>For an undirected graph, the degree of a vertex i is equal to its row sum:</li>
  <li>
    <p>For a directed graph, the row sum is the out-degree, and the column sum is the in-degree.</p>
  </li>
  <li>If we want to answer questions about a graph such as:
    <ul>
      <li>How many edges are there in G?</li>
      <li>Is G connected?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An adjacency matrix requires O(n2) time.
    <ul>
      <li>This may be inefficient when number of edges is small. (The graph is sparse.)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h4 id="6132-adjacency-lists">6.1.3.2 Adjacency Lists</h4>

<ul>
  <li>In an adjacency list, the n rows of the adjacency matrix are represented as n chains (or sequential lists).
    <ul>
      <li>One chain for each vertex in G</li>
      <li>Nodes in chain i represent the vertices that are adjacent from vertex i.
        <ul>
          <li>The vertices in each chain are not required to be ordered.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>An array adjLists is used so that we can access the adjacency list for any vertex in O(1) time.
        <ul>
          <li>adjList[i] is the pointer to the first node in the adjacency list for vertex i.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135758565-e76debe7-b884-4d4b-add1-0c6f2cfe2ccf.png" alt="image-20210923182655767" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>For a graph with n vertices and e edges, the linked adjacency list representation requires an array of size n and 2e chain nodes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>In order to answer questions such as
    <ul>
      <li>How many edges are there in G?</li>
      <li>Is G connected?</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>An adjacency list requires O(n+e) time.</li>
  <li>If e is much smaller than n2, then using adjacency list can be more efficient than using an adjacency matrix.</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="6134-weighted-edges">6.1.3.4 Weighted Edges</h4>

<p><img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135760851-43e029f5-2bad-493d-a686-e7050608d1dd.png" alt="image" /></p>

<ul>
  <li>In many applications, the edges of a graph have weights assigned to them.</li>
  <li>These weights may represent the distance from one vertex to another or the cost of going from one vertex to another.</li>
  <li>In an adjacency matrix, a[i][j] will now be the edge weight.</li>
  <li>In an adjacency list, the list nodes should have an additional field, weight.</li>
  <li>A graph with weighted edges is called a network.</li>
</ul>
