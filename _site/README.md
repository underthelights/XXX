# Greetings! I'm Kyuhwan Shim. ðŸ¤— 

My research currently focused on the intersection of visual grounding and leveraging multimodal models to reason about the real-world as an agent. My long-term goal is to develop robot-learning paradigms in real-world problems by enhancing visual reasoning and grounding objects with language understandings.

I am pursuing my Master's Degree at Grauduate School of Artificial Intelligence in Seoul National University. I received my Bachelor's Degree from Sogang Unviersity.
