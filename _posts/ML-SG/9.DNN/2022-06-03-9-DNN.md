# 9. DNN
Property 1: Goodfellow6-9

# Deep Learning

- A machine learning subfield. Exceptional performance in learning patterns.
- Deep learning algorithms attempt to learn (multiple levels of) representation by using a hierarchy of multiple layers.
- If you provide the system tons of information, it begins to understand it and respond in useful ways.

- Manually designed features are often over-specified, incomplete and take a long time to design and validate
- Learned Features are easy to adapt, fast to learn
- Deep learning provides a very flexible, (almost?) universal, learnable
framework for representing world, visual and linguistic information.
- Can learn both unsupervised and supervised
- Effective end-to-end joint system learning
- Utilize large amounts of training data

## History

- In ~2012, deep learning (DL) started outperforming other machine learning (ML) techniques, first in speech and vision, then NLP

## Structure

어떻게 DL이 좋은 성능을 내는가?

- Fat + Short vs. Thin + Tall Networks
- The same number of parameters

# Dropout

[Dropout [6]](https://www.notion.so/9-DNN-4bd3fcaa9c98476dbe325f886d729985)

- Each time before computing the gradients
- Each neuron has $p \times 100 \%$ chance to be dropped
    - The structure of the network is changed
- Use the new network for training

![Untitled_13](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/188280877-2dc86cb3-9b0d-4d4e-a023-9033c7feecfe.png)

- Weights should be multiplied by (1-p) when testing

## Training stage

Assume dropout rate is 50% 

![Untitled_15](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/188280880-ff0c4282-cd2d-4a25-8f52-c12f00c7b30f.png)

### Testing stage

No dropout

![Untitled_16](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/188280882-0f356b1b-47ae-4161-ba6c-0bae951b40ef.png)

# Convolutional Neural Network

## Fully connected layer

- Example: 200x200 image * 40K hidden units → ~2B parameters

![Slide Credit: Marc'Aurelio Ranzato](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/188280884-b24fcebf-e58f-4fa8-91a0-f07fb0ae74f4.png)

Slide Credit: Marc'Aurelio Ranzato

- Waste of resources + we have not enough training samples
- Spatial correlation is local

## Locally Connected Layer

- Example: 200x200 image * 40K hidden units → ~4M parameters (Filter size: 10x10)
Page 20- Spatial correlation is local

![Untitled_18](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/188280885-abf3d04d-52d9-4cc0-8e77-652c6a175602.png)

- Waste of resources + we have not enough training samples
- Spatial correlation is local

![Untitled_19](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/188280888-46729577-a232-4023-83ae-b674f374652f.png)

- Statistics is similar at different locations
    - Share the same parameters across
- different locations (weight sharing)
    - Convolutions with learned kernels
    

## Convolution operation

$F(m,n) = f * h = \Sigma_{l= -\frac w 2}^{\frac f 2}\Sigma_{k= -\frac w 2}^{\frac w 2} {f(m+k, n+l) *h(\frac w 2 -k, \frac w 2 -l)}$

![Untitled_20](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/188280891-91050b9e-3257-4c55-8b39-17d9cfdb9f02.png)
![Untitled_21](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/188280892-f7bb4b05-ff9c-4279-ab46-2a5d1fc9c858.png)


- If a feature is useful in some locations during training, detectors for that feature will be useful in all locations during testing

![Untitled_22](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/188280893-984efb4c-2f50-4619-ada2-f6163419c454.png)

## Pooling

- By “pooling” (e.g., taking max) filter responses at different locations, we gain robustness to the exact spatial location of features.

### Max-pooling

$h_i^n(r,c) = max_{\bar r \in N(r), \bar c \in N(c), } h_i^{n-1} (\bar r, \bar c)$

### Average-pooling

$h_i^n(r,c) = mean_{\bar r \in N(r), \bar c \in N(c), } h_i^{n-1} (\bar r, \bar c)$

### L2-pooling

$h_i^n(r,c) = \sqrt{\Sigma_{\bar r \in N(r), \bar c \in N(c), } h_i^{n-1} (\bar r, \bar c)}$

## LeNet-5 (1998)

[[7] Le-Net](https://www.notion.so/9-DNN-4bd3fcaa9c98476dbe325f886d729985)

- Yann LeCun and his collaborators developed a really good recognizer for
handwritten digits by using backpropagation in a feedforward net with
    - Many hidden layers (at that time),
    - 3 convolution layer,
    - 2 subsampling (pooling) layer
    - 5*5 convolution kernels,
    - ~340,000 connections,
    - ~60,000 parameter
- Used for reading ~10% of the checks in North America

## Backpropagation in CNN

- Same color shares the same weight
- Compute the gradients as usual, and then modify the gradients so that they satisfy the constraints

![Untitled](9/Untitled_32.png)

![Untitled](9/Untitled_33.png)

- The 82 errors made by LeNet5
- Notice that most of the errors are cases that people find quite easy.
- The human error rate is probably 20 to 30 errors.

- LeNet uses knowledge about the invariances to design:
    - local connectivity
    - weight-sharing
    - Pooling
    - ~ 80 errors
- Using many different transformations of the input and other tricks (Ranzato2008)
    - ~ 40 errors
- Using carefully designed extra training data (Ciresan 2010)
    - For each training image, they produced many new training examples by applying many different transformations
    - ~ 35 errors

[Ciresan 2010][8]

PyTorch implementation of LeNet-5 for MNIST, [https://github.com/radsn/LeNet5](https://github.com/radsn/LeNet5)

- The top printed digit is the right answer.
- The bottom two printed digits are the network’s best two guesses.
- The right answer is almost always in the top 2 guesses.
- With model averaging they can now get about 25 errors.

# From Handwritten Digits to 3-D objects

- Recognizing real objects in color photographs downloaded from the web is much more complicated than recognizing hand-written digits:
    - Hundred times as many classes (1000 vs 10)
    - Hundred times as many pixels (256* 256 color vs. 28* 28 gray)
    - Two dimensional image of three-dimensional scene
    - Multiple objects in each image
    - Cluttered background
- Will the same type of convolutional neural network work?

# The ILSVRC-2012 Competition on ImageNet

![Untitled](9/Untitled_35.png)

- [9] ImageNet
    - Over 15 million labeled high-resolution images
    - Roughly 22,000 categories
    - Collected from the web
    - Labeled by human using Amazon’s Mechanical Turk crowd-sourcing tool

- ImageNet Large-Scale Visual Recognition Challenge (ILSVRC)
    - Uses a subset of ImageNet
    - 1,000 categories
    - 1.2 million training images
    - 50,000 validation images
    - 150,000 test images
- The classification task:
    - Get the “correct” class in your top 5 bets. There are 1000 classes.
- The localization task:
    - For each bet, put a box around the object. Your box must have at least 50%
    overlap with the correct box.
- Some of the best existing computer vision methods were tried on this dataset by leading computer vision groups from Oxford, INRIA, XRCE(XEROX), …
    - Computer vision systems use complicated multi-stage systems
    - The early stages are typically hand-tuned by optimizing a few parameters

# A CNN for ImageNet

AlexNet[10]

- Alex Krizhevsky (NIPS 2012) developed a very deep convolutional neural net of the type pioneered by Yann LeCun.

- 7 hidden layers not counting some max pooling layers
- The early layers are convolutional, the last two layers are fully connected
- The activation functions are
    - Rectified linear units in every hidden layer. These train much faster and are more expressive than sigmoid.
    - Normalization for better activation
- Use “dropout” to regularize the weights in the fully connected layers
- 224*224 patches are taken from the 256*256 images (10 different versions) and leftright reflections are used to get more data
- Used all 10 different patches at test time

![Untitled](9/Untitled_37.png)

## More examples from AlexNet

![Untitled](9/Untitled_38.png)

## Hardware for AlexNet

- He uses a very efficient implementation of convolutional nets on two NvidiaGTX 580 Graphics Processor Units (over 1000 fast little cores)
    - GPUs are very good for matrix-matrix multiplies.
    - GPUs have very high bandwidth to memory.
    - This allows him to train the network in a week.
    - It also makes it quick to combine results from 10 patches at test time.
- We can spread a network over many cores if we can communicate the states fast enough.
- As cores get cheaper and datasets get bigger, big neural nets will improve faster than old-fashioned computer vision systems.

- Prediction from Rodney Brooks:
“By 2020, the popular press starts having stories that the era of Deep Learning is over.”

- 2019 is the year it became cool to say that “deep learning” has limitations.
- Books, articles, lectures, debates, videos were released that learning-based methods cannot do commonsense reasoning.
