## Binary Trees(Chapter 5.2)

### 5.2.1 The Abstract Data Type

- Definition
  - A binary tree is a finite set of nodes that is either empty or consists of a root and two disjoint binary trees called the left subtree and the right subtree.

  
  
- The major characteristic of a binary tree is that the degree of any given node must not exceed two.

- For binary trees, we distinguish between the left subtree and the right subtree

  - For general trees the order of the subtrees is irrelevant.

  - The following two trees are different binary trees.

###  5.2.2 Properties of Binary Trees

- Maximum number of nodes in a binary tree

  - The maximum number of nodes on level i of a binary tree is 2 ^ i - 1

  - The maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of depth k is 2 ^ k - 1

#### Full binary tree

- A full binary tree of depth k is a binary tree of depth k having 2 ^ k - 1 nodes. (k ‚â• 0)

- We can number the nodes of a full binary tree, starting with the root on level 1, continuing with the nodes on level 2, and so on.Nodes on any level are numbered from left to right.
- A full binary tree of depth 4 with sequential node numbers

#### Complete binary tree

- A binary tree with n nodes and depth k is complete iff its nodes correspond to the nodes numbered from 1 to n in the full binary tree of depth k.

- The depth of a complete binary tree with n nodes is log2(ùëõ + 1) .

- A complete binary tree with 12 nodes.

### 5.2.3 Binary Tree Representations

#### Array Representation

- We can use an array to represent a binary tree.

  - First, number the nodes using the numbering scheme used for a full binary tree.

  - The node that is numbered i is stored in tree[i].

  ‚Äã	 - tree[0] is reserved and not used.

  - An n node binary tree needs an array whose length is between n + 1 and 2n

- If a complete binary tree with n nodes is represented sequentially, then for any node with index i, 1 ‚â§ i ‚â§ n, we have :

  - (1) parent(i) is at ùëñ / 2 (i > 1).   If i = 1, i is at the root and has no parent.
  - (2) left_child(i) is at 2i, if 2i ‚â§ n.  If 2i > n, then i has no left child.
  - (3) right_child(i) is at 2i + 1 if 2i + 1 ‚â§ n,  If 2i + 1 > n, then i has no right child.

#### Linked Represenation

- Each binary tree node has data plus two links : one for the left childand one for the right child.

- The space required by an n - node binary tree is n * (sizeof(node)).

```
struct node {
  char data;
  struct node *left_child, *right_child;
};
typedef struct node *tree_pointer;
```
