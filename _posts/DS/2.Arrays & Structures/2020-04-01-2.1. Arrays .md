## Arrays (Chapter 2.1)

### 2.1.1 Arrays as an abstract data type

- A set of pairs <index, value>, such that each index has a value associated with it.
  - $<0, 99>, <1, 88>, <2, 77>, <3, 66>, <4, 55>$
  - $<0, 'a'>, <1, 'b'>, <2, 'c'>, <3, 'd'>, <4, 'e'>$
  
  
- Many operations can be applied to arrays, but standard operations are:
  - create an array
  - store a value in the array
  - retrieve a value from the array

#### An example specification of ADT Array

### 2.1.2 Arrays in C

- Arrays are supported as a composite data type in C

- Declaration of one-dimensional arrays in C

  ```c
  int list[5];
  ```

  - This line reserves memory space for five integers. â€¢ Memory allocation of arrays

| Variable | Memory Address      |
| -------- | ------------------- |
| list[0]  | base address = a    |
| list[1]  | a + sizeof(int)     |
| list[2]  | a + 2 * sizeof(int) |
| list[3]  | a + 3 * sizeof(int) |
| list[4]  | a + 4 * sizeof(int) |

- When you declare an integer array as follows, list2 is interpreted as a pointer to an integer.

  ```c
  int list2[5];
  ```

- In other words, list2 is the same type as list1 which is declared as a pointer to an integer.

  ```c
  int *list1;
  ```

  

- The difference is that for list2, memory space for 5 integers are reserved.

- To use list1 as an integer array, memory should be allocated dynamically.



- We can use list2 as a pointer

  ```
       int list2[5];
  ```

  - list2: a pointer to list2[0]
  - list2 + i: a pointer to list2[i]
  - (list2+i) is equal to &list2[i]
  - *(list2+i) is equal to list2[i]

### Program 2.1 [ex002]
<script src="https://gist.github.com/underthelights/d749f5a8ce2ca8bbb689d373f0602d49.js"></script>

- When function sum is called, input (pointer to input[0]) is copied into a temporary location and is associated with the formal parameter list. 

  ```c
  answer = sum(input, MAX_SIZE);
  ```

- When list[i] occurs on the right-hand side of '=' in an assignment statement, a dereferencing takes place and the value pointed at by (list+i) is returned.

  ```
  tempsum += list[i];
  ```

- If list[i] appears on the left-hand side of '=', then the value produced on the right-hand side is stored in the location (list+i).

### Program 2.2 [ex003]

- print1 is a function that prints out both the address of the ith element and the value found at this address.
