## Polynomials (Chapter 2.4)

### 2.4.1 Polynomials

- Arrays are not only data structures in their own right, but we can also use them to implement other abstract data types.

  - A polynomial ADT can be implemented using arrays.

  

- A polynomial, viewed from a mathematical perspective, is a sum of terms, where each term has a form axe.

  - x is the variable, a is the coefficient, and e is the exponent.

  

- Examples  
  - $A(X)=3X^2 +2X+4$
  - $B(X)=X^4 +10X^3 +3X^2 +1$

### 2.4.2 Polynomial Representation

- There are many ways to represent a polynomial. 
- dense representation, sparse representation

#### Dense representation

 - include all terms in a polynomial, including terms that have zero coefficient.

```c
#define MAX_DEGREE 101
typedef struct {
  int degree;
  int coef[MAX_DEGREE];
} polynomial;
```

- For example, for polynomial
  - $A(x) = a_n x^n + ... + a_1 x + a_0$ where $a_n \neq 0$
  - a.degree = n
  - a.coef[i]= $a_i$  $0≤i≤n$

####  [ex008]  

- Advantage of dense representation
  - operations can be implemented in a simple manner

    - e.g.) adding two polynomials
  
    
  
- Problem of dense representation

  - may waste a lot of memory space if
    - a.degree is much smaller than MAX_DEGREE

    - polynomial is sparse (most terms have zero coefficients)

  - examples
    - $A(x) = 2x^{1000} + 1$
    - $B(x) = x^{4} + 10x^3 + 3x^2 +1$
    
    

- Sparse representation
  - Each term of a polynomial includes exponent and coefficient.
  - Does not need to store terms that have zero coefficient.
  
  
- Example: Using a single global array to store multiple polynomials.

```c
#define MAX_TERMS 100
typedef struct {
int coef;
    int expon;
} polynomial;
polynomial terms[MAX_TERMS];
int avail = 0;
```

- When we store a polynomial in the array, we need to specify the start ane finish point of a polynomial.



- Sparse representation: array representation of two polynomials.
  - Example
    - $A(x) = 2x^{1000} + 1$
    - $B(x) = x^{4} + 10x^3 + 3x^2 +1$
  - For a zero polynomial c, set startc > finishc.

- Sparse representation saves memory space, but operations become complex

  - e.g.) adding two polynomials

#### Program 2.6 [ex009]

- Function padd adds two polynomials.
- COMPARE is a function takes two arguments and returns -1 (the first argument is smaller), 0 (equal), or 1 (larger)
