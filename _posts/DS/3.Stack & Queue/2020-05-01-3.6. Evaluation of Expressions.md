## Evaluation of Expressions (Chapter 3.6)

### 3.6.1 Expressions

- The representation and evaluation of expressions is of great interest to computer scientists.
- Example expressions
  - `((rear + 1 == front) || (( rear == MAX_QUEUE_SIZE-1) && !front))`
  
  - $x=a/b–c+d*e–a*$



- Tokens in expressions
  
  - operators (e.g. $=, /, -, +, *$)
  - operands (e.g. $a, b, c, d, e, x$)
  - parentheses
  
  
  
- Suppose we have the following statement.

  - $x=a/b–c+d*e–a*c$

  

- When a=4,b=2,c=2,d=3,and e=3,what is the value of x?
  - Which one is correct?
     - $((4/2)–2)+(3*3)–(4*2)=0+9–8=1$
     - $(4/(2–2+3))*(3–4)*2=4/3*(-1)*2=-2.666...$
     
     
  
- Within any programming language, there is a precedence hierarchy that **determines the order** in which we evaluate operators.

- Parentheses are used to override precedence, and the expresisons are always evaluated from the innermost parenthesized expression first.

- When two operators of the same precedence appear in an expression, they are evaluated according to the associativity.

- Precedence hierarchy for C

 - Infix notation: $a * b$

   - (operator is placed between the operands) 


- Prefix notation: $* a b$

  - (operator is placed before the operands)
  
  
- Postfix notation: $a b *$

  - (operator is placed after the operands)

  

- Prefix and Postfix notations are parenthesis-freenotations.

- Although infix notation is the most common way of writing expressions, it is not the one used by compilers to evaluate expressions.
- Compilers typically use postfix notation, which is a parenthesis-free notation.

  | Infix                | Postfix       |
  | -------------------- | ------------- |
  | 2+3*4                | 234*+         |
  | a*b+5                | ab*5+         |
  | (1+2)*7              | 1 2+7*        |
  | a*b/c                | ab*c/         |
  | ((a/(b-c+d))*(e-a)*c | abc-d+/ea-*c* |
  | a/b-c+d*e-a*c        | ab/c-de*+ac*- |

### 3.6.2 Evaluating Postfix Expressions

- To evaluate a postfix expression, we make a single left-to-right scan.

  -  Step 1: Place the operands on a stack until we findan operator

  -  Step 2: Remove, from the stack, the correct number of operands for the operator

  -  Step 3: Perform the operation

  -  Step 4: Place the result back on the stack

Infix: $6 / 2 - 3 + 4 * 2 $

Postfix: $6 2 / 3 - 4 2 * +$

- Assumptions

  -  To simplify our task, let us assume that the expression contains only the binary operators: $+, -, *, /, $and $\%$.

  -  Also, the operands in the expressions are all single digit integers. - Declarations

### 3.6.3 Infix To Postfix

- An algorithm for producing a postfix expression from an infix one
  - Step 1: Fully parenthesize the expression
  - Step 2: Move all binary operators so that they replace their corresponding right parenthesis
  - Step 3: Delete all parenthesis



- Example: $a/b–c+d*e–a*c$
  - AfterStep1: $((((a/b)–c)+(d*e))–(a*c))$
  - AfterStep2 and 3: $ab/c–de*+ac*-$



- Although this algorithm works well when done by hand, it is inefficient on a computer because it requires two passes.

- Note that the order of operands is the same in infix and postfix.

- Thus, we can form the postfix equivalent by scanning the infix expression left-to-right.

- However, the order in which the operators are output depends on their precedence.

- Since we must output the higher precendence operators first, we save operators until we know their correct placement.
  - We stack operators as long as the precedence of the operator at the top of the stack is less than the precendence of the incoming operator.

  
  
- Parenthesized expression

  -  Stack "(" and operators until we reach ")".

  -  At this point we unstack until we reach the corresponding "(".

  -  Delete ")".


 - Example: Translation of a+b*c to postfix

<img width="204" alt="image-20211003150755011" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751255-258a08d3-66d1-40b0-b13a-7cf1354789b6.png">

 - Example: Translation of a*(b+c)/d to postfix

<img width="204" alt="image-20211003150806278" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46957634/135751257-ab10c6eb-ee51-4155-83d9-71c5ebdb9ac4.png">

- The analysis of the two examples suggests a precedence-based scheme for stacking and unstacking operators.
- We need two types of precedence, an in-stack precedence (isp) and an incoming precedence (icp).
  - Remove an operator from the stack only if its isp >= icp of the new operator.

```c
precedence stack[MAX_STACK_SIZE];
/* isp and icp arrays - index is value of precendence for
   lparen, rparen, plus, minus, times, divide, mod, eos */
static int isp[] = {0, 19, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 0};
static int icp[] = {20, 19, 12, 12, 13, 13, 13, 0};
```

#### Analysis of postfix

- Let n be the number of tokens in the expression
- Θ(n) time is spent extracting tokens and outputting them.
- Θ(n) time is spent in two while loops, as the number of tokens that get stacked and unstacked is linear in n.
- Thus, the time complexity of function postfix is Θ(n).
