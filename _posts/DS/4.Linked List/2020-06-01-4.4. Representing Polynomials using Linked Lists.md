## Representing Polynomials using Linked Lists (Chapter 4.4)

### Polynomials

- Previously, we have looked at representing polynomials using arrays. Here, we would like to use linked lists to represent polynomials.

  $A(x) = a_{m-1} x^{e_m-1} + ... + a_0 x^{e_0}$

- Sparse representation of polynomials
  - We are going to store the coefficient of each term along with the exponent.

- Example representations

### 4.4.2 Adding Polynomials [ex026]

- Program 4.9 
  - Compare this program with Program 2.6 (ex009).

#### Analysis of Function padd

- Similar to the analysis of Program 2.6.

- Three cost measures:
  - coefficient additions
  - exponent comparisons
  - creation of new nodes for d
- 0 ≤ number of coefficient additions ≤ $min[m, n]$
- number of exponent comparisons and creation of new nodes is at most $m+n$

- Therefore, its time complexity is $O(m + n)$



### 4.4.3 Erasing Polynomials

- If a linked list representing a polynomial is no longer needed, we need to free the allocated memory.

- We can use the following function erase to accomplish this.
  - We should always make a link to the next node before deleting the current node.

### 4.4.4 Representing Polynomials as Circular Lists

- We can represent a polynomial using a circular list.

  - The last node points to the first node, instead of NULL

- If the last node points to NULL, the structure is called a chain.

#### What is better if we use a circular list? 

- Suppose we frequently create and delete polynomials. 
- Whenever we delete a polynomial, we go through all the nodes in the linked list and free the nodes. (refer to function erase.) 
- When we delete a polynomial, instead of deallocating memory from all of its nodes, we will maintain a list of "available nodes" that can be reused.

- Now whenever we need a new node, we will examine the list of available nodes.

  - If the list is not empty, then we will use one of its nodes.

  - If the list is empty, then we will use malloc to create a new node.

  - The function get_node will implement this operation.

- function get_node: retrieve a node from the available node list, or create a new node using malloc.

- function ret_node: return a node to the available list

- function cerase: erase a circular list
  - What is the time complexity of this function, with regard to number of nodes in the circular list?

- Head node

  - With circular lists, a zero polynomial becomes a special case that needs to be handled separately.
    -  An If statement is used in the function cerase.

    
    
  - We can avoid this by introducing a head node into each polynomial.
  
  - With head node representation, we may move the test for (*ptr) in the function cerase.
